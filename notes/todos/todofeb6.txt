todo feb 12
move outline into outline.txt
    follow outline

    todos based on outline 
        create simple mode for nav
            what exactly are the differences in the simple mode?
                no search bars just the home page / login component
                size is normal on the smallest breakpoint

        create space to attach thoughts / photos for each rating dimension
            the numbers don't tell the full story
            the user should share why they think the tortilla was a 9.5
            
            creating the component with the necessary functions is easy
                fiting it into the ui is the tricky part
                    thoughts:
                        photos that select a dimension will already be there
                        use camera + writing symbols / emojis as the buttons
                            hover:button shows current caption / photos

        update the messages that are shown based on the rating score
        move the theme store to the stores/stores.ts file

        move all of the google autocomplete functions into its own component
        make login component just 1 button not "login, signup"
            and if user the show pfp with badges
        
        
        create burrito lookup component
            similar to the autocomplete found in the nav search bars
                main difference: burritoLookup just looks through the database, NOT Google
        recentlyEaten burritos component
            use this on multiple pages
            ask if the user has eaten these options
                sort by 
                    recently visited pages: burrito -> restaurants, 
                    places with similar names to past searches
    footer component
        sitemap
        list of links and info
