create custom markers

    notes:
        yelp uses a basic one that inverts the border/bg color on hover
        if i want to do this it might be easier to use css than to use two images

        the content is what sets the marker image
        it is a document.createElement

create info windows
get search location and use that as the center
search by query
finish resty form
increase typing speed

make everything fit! 
condense amenties to the import ones... see full amenities

handle tags that don't exist instead of throwing a 500 error

create restaurant page

burrito criteria


current task create an info window that opens on hover


im going to make my own html elements instead of using the info windows that google has


change animation to:
    instant in 
    fade out

create little pointy for the infocard....

goal is to let autocomplete fill in a real address
only submit restaurant form for real address
need to check it

Geocode address / coordinates into geohash data

after restaurant is submitted ask for additional info

Amenities?
menu?
Hours?
photos?

make the resty result wider

get tags from url


there are 1 million different things to add some off the top of my head are
functions to add photos to storage
use all of the photos as a slideshow
login functionality
restaurant pages
filters

we need to add way more data points to get a filtered search going
price amenities vibe etc
query search

how to get review data into each restaurantdata object

the search results need 
    average rating
    number of reviews
    preview of a good review



focus: 
    get the filter integrated

    mode needs to be in url
    tags specific to mode
    because burritos will have different tags than restaurants
    all tags need to be stored in a giant list
    also when a user is adding a tag they will have all of the previous ones to chosoe from


fix the filter function based on the suggestion by chat gpt

sort the categories of filters in order then each filter in each category has an order. not too complicated


for the filters to be highly reactive and functional they should be made into stores that way they instantly start a search with the correct filters
