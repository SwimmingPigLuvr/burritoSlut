google sign in
    use a popup for desktop
    use a redirect for mobile

    is there a way to check if mobile device?
        first answer is screen size but there are big tablets that might not handle a pop up well?

current actions:
    paste in googleauth sign in function


right now i have routes/login & routes/signup
but i should have routes/login/+page.svlete
so looking at my past sign in logic

right now i need to consolidate the login page with the signup page and just toggle which one were getting into based on the users status
    
    **routes/signup/+page.svelte
    1. sign in with google

    **routes/signup/username/+page.svelte
    2. if $userData?.username
            welcome {$userData.username}
        else <form on:submit|preventDefault={confirmUsername}>
                <input
                    type="text"
                    placeholder="username"
                    class="input"
                    bind:value={username}
                    on:input={checkAvailability}
                    class:input-error={(!isValid && isTouched)}
                    class:input-warning={isTaken}
                    class:input-success={isAvailable && isValid && !loading}
                />
    

    how to consolidate the two pages:

    if $user

    boom thats it. it takes the user store that we created earlier

    this actually handles a different but still neccessary thing

    so if the user is signed in already then ...

    why would they even be here

    but if an account exists already they are in the login page but how would we know that? i think we should have 2 different pages

    but they should both act just like the sign in that we have in the other project where it checks if the user store is signed in then we handle it differently


    so essentially the google sign in and the google log in are 1 in the same
        google{signup/login}
            if account exists => login
            else => sign up

    going to document everything that i do

    right now im looking through my files to see what my first step is
        notes:
            i need to toggle a state for signup / login
            well if these are on the same page for convenience
                i want to denote this state in the url so that a login / signup page can be sent
                    that actually doesn't make sense i can share the login page and if they arent signed up already then we just switch it then. i doubt that will turn users away

    now that the state is set up i need to compartmentalize the areas that each state controls


    well i just got sidetracked on the safemode but at least i figured it out


    also just realized if we are signing up with goog we dont need all the random info like the birthday etc..

    so the normal login and the google/provider logins will be separated
