fix map. configure query

create review form so the users can add burritos and restaurants

configure auth so users can sign in



ui ideas

take a page out of y**p's book

search results on the left
map on the right
markers correlating to the search results


maps are only ever used for search results
and directions once we are on a restaurant page
the map.svelte component is for search results
the directions.svelte component is for specific restaurant directions

need components for many different things
search results

restuarant page
    has multiple inside it as well the menu can be a component
    info card: website, phone directions, suggest an edit


routes ideas

burritoBudyy.com/search

use search params in the routing

https://www.burritoSlut.com/search?find_desc=Breakfast+Burrito&find_loc=Newport+Beach,%20CA

this will be the url when a user searches for "breakfast burrito", with the location set to "newport beach, ca"


map component ideas:

use search to fetch data.
use fetched data to order and place markers
hovering marker shows data for that burrito place


main focus of this app is the search
the top nav bar should be a search bar that let's the user search from everypage


left side = search filters


make the map invisible on the mobile screen size
use a map icon in the top right to let the user click on it and see the search results

get rid of full screen map option
i can't think of a reason why someone would want that anyways
