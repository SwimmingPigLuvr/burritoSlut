fix map. configure query

create review form so the users can add burritos and restaurants

configure auth so users can sign in



ui ideas

take a page out of y**p's book

search results on the left
map on the right
markers correlating to the search results


maps are only ever used for search results
and directions once we are on a restaurant page
the map.svelte component is for search results
the directions.svelte component is for specific restaurant directions

need components for many different things
search results

restuarant page
    has multiple inside it as well the menu can be a component
    info card: website, phone directions, suggest an edit


routes ideas

burritoBudyy.com/search

use search params in the routing

https://www.burritoSlut.com/search?find_desc=Breakfast+Burrito&find_loc=Newport+Beach,%20CA

this will be the url when a user searches for "breakfast burrito", with the location set to "newport beach, ca"


map component ideas:

use search to fetch data.
use fetched data to order and place markers
hovering marker shows data for that burrito place


main focus of this app is the search
the top nav bar should be a search bar that let's the user search from everypage


left side = search filters


make the map invisible on the mobile screen size
use a map icon in the top right to let the user click on it and see the search results

get rid of full screen map option
i can't think of a reason why someone would want that anyways

add autocomplete for places / burritos
contain to location


now let's write reviews

that way i can manually enter in new restaurants and burritos
then once the db is a little bit more populated i can test out how the search works

oh wait i guess i should have auth enabled before

figure out the auth


form notes

birthday
only allow date options for specific months
for example feb has 28 days


autocomplete:

add suggestions to the left search bar

    these are types of burritos names etc. not addresses

add current location to the top of the address autocomplete on the left
find out how to style autocomplete

figure out how to run auto complete config twice so that there are 2 different types of suto complete


let's get going with the search results component

components:
    filters
        left hand side
        or condensed version on top for mobile
    search
        middle of the page between map and filters
        components:
            result
                info?
    map
        components:
            result
                photo / title / reviews on marker hover

i need one unified search query that sends the relevant data to each component
all of the data is in the db
    i just have to figure out which functions pull it out
        and i have to figure out how to set search params

setting up the fetch data functions so that i can search for the burritos from the db

should i pass the data into the search page so that it is available for the maps as well?

yes because the alternative would be to pass data into each one separately so i have to pass the data anyways shrug

instead of having a single prop for the search results and having to switch everything for whether its a burrito search or a restaurant search
i'll just make burritoresults.svelte and restaurantresults.svelte
boom way easier


for the home page im thinking we should make the slider into a component

that way i can easily code in the fact that a certain slide is active and they can be more customizable

then i can easily add new data into these in the future

find out why this is fine
// fetch restaurant by ID
    const restaurantRef = doc(db, "restaurants", restaurantId);
    const restaurantDoc = await getDoc(restaurantRef);

but this isn't
// fetch each burrito by ID
    const burritoIds = restaurantData.menu;
    const burritoDocs = await Promise.all(
        burritoIds.map(burritoId => {
            const burritoRef = doc(db, "burritos", burritoId);
            const burritoDoc = getDoc(burritoRef)
        })
    );
