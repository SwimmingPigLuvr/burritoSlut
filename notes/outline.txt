rating system + questions

i think that the rating doesn't always give enough info

we should ask the users to describe details about the burritos

for example was it spicy?
that shouldn't be a factor into the overall score
that's purely informational

solution:
spice level?
🫑🌶️🔥🌋

that way we can categorize burritos

some users might like really cheesy burrito
but if they just see the raw rating that won't be good info
